        This specification is provided to promote interoperability among implementations and users of in-band text tracks sourced for [[HTML5]] from media resource containers. The specification provides guidelines for the creation of video, audio and text tracks and their attribute values as mapped from in-band tracks from media resource types typically supported by User Agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mappings are defined for [[MPEGDASH]], [[ISOBMFF]], [[MPEG2TS]], [[OGGSKELETON]] and [[WebM]].

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The specification maintains mappings from in-band audio, video and other data tracks of MIME-type/subtype media resources to HTML VideoTrack, AudioTrack, and TextTrack objects and their attribute values.
      </p>
      <p>
        A generic rule to follow is that a track as exposed in HTML only ever represents a single semantic concept. For example, a HTML TextTrack object is either a subtitle track or a caption track. Assuming, caption tracks contain additional cues with transcripts of audio-only information that subtitle tracks do not require, it is possible that a media container may encapsulate a subtitle and a caption track in a single in-band track to save space. In HTML, these tracks will be exposed as two TextTrack objects. This allows users to choose between the two tracks and activate the desired one in the same manner that they do it if the two tracks were provided through two track elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another generic rule to follow for in-band data tracks is that in order to map them to TextTrack objects, they need to be mapped to media-time aligned cues that relate to a non-zero interval of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For every MIME-type/subtype of an existing media container format, this specification defines the following information:
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>Implied track order.</li>
          <li>Setting track attributes 'id', 'kind', 'language' and 'label'.</li>
          <li>For other data tracks: how to create text track cues.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
